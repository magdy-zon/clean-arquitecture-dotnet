# Clean architecture example with automapper
> "Clean Architecture is an architectural pattern that emphasizes the separation of concerns and the use of loosely coupled components in developing software systems."

> "Clean Architecture is a design pattern that separates an application into different layers based on their responsibility"

> "The primary goal of Clean Architecture is to create a structure that makes it easy to manage and maintain an application as it grows and changes over time."

## Domain layer
> "The domain layer should be completely independent of any implementation details or infrastructure concerns and should be focused solely on representing the business domain."

## Application layer
> "This layer contains the business logic of the application and orchestrates the interaction between the presentation layer and the domain layer."

## Infrastructure Layer
> "The infrastructure layer is responsible for providing concrete implementations of the abstractions defined in the other layers."

## Presentation Layer: 
> "This layer contains the UI components of the application, such as the views, controllers, and models, which are responsible for presenting data to the user and accepting user input."
